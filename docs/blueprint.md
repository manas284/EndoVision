## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#003366) to convey trust and professionalism. It evokes a sense of stability, depth, and medical authority.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F7FA) providing a clean, calm backdrop, which supports readability and reduces eye strain. It provides a gentle contrast against the primary deep blue.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) to highlight calls to action, creating emphasis and guiding users through the site. Its vibrancy contrasts with the primary and background colors, while connecting to themes of quality.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to provide a tech-forward, clean feel paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text for optimal readability.
- Use line-based icons (Feather, Lucide, or Heroicons) to maintain a modern, consistent, and clean aesthetic across the site.
- Implement a 12-column grid system with a maximum container width of 1200px, ensuring content is well-structured and responsive across devices.
- Subtle animations on hover for buttons and cards to improve user engagement and provide visual feedback.
